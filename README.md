Whoscored Scraper <br>

# Part One - pOne.py
First implementation <br>
Does the job for looping though teams and season <br>
Scrapes Data from the summary table <br>

# Part Two - pTwo.py
Second implementation <br>
Now trying to scrape through the Defensive,Offensive and Passing tables. <br>

# To Do
The different part are just to keep early implementation intact <br>
while building on top of them. <br>

Eventually will have to access data from the detailed tab as well. <br>
This will involve selecting option from drop down menus. <br>

There might be some trouble later with pOne. <br>
This would be with relegation and promotion. <br>
Will probably have to write a try except to get around it. <br>
