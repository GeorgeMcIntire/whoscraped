Whoscored Scraper

# Part One - pOne.py
First implementation |
Does the job for looping though teams and season |
Scrapes Data from the summary table |

# Part Two - pTwo.py
Second implementation |
Now trying to scrape through the Defensive,Offensive and Passing tables.

# To Do
The different part are just to keep early implementation intact |
while building on top of them. |

Eventually will have to access data from the detailed tab as well. |
This will involve selecting option from drop down menus. |

There might be some trouble later with pOne. |
This would be with relegation and promotion. |
Will probably have to write a try except to get around it. |
